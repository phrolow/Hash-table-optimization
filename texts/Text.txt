Forty years as under anesthesia
I worked as a shit carrier
Oh oh oh...
Not a driver, not a taxi driver
And smelly shitty
Oh oh oh...
For three hundred bills
I drove poop on ZIL
Oh oh oh...
And I'll tell you so you know:
Oh, and you fucked up a lot!
Oh oh oh...
Shit truck, shit truck, shit truck
Do not clean the shit from the wheels
Even if you pour perfume
It still stinks...
Shit-cleaner, shit-cleaner, shit-cleaner
Must be hardened and broad-shouldered
Shit-cleaner - a shit caster!
Needed by people at all times.

I don't know how the West is
Maybe they smell less?
Oh oh oh...
Our naseret in a payphone
And release so much stink
Oh oh oh...
Like eating less
So you need to take it easy
Oh oh oh...
But where does it come from
Twice as many people shit
Oh oh oh...
Shit truck, shit truck, shit truck
There are many tulips and roses in the world
Lots of sweets and wine in the world
But even more in the world of shit ...
Shit-cleaner, shit-cleaner, shit-cleaner
Must be hardened and broad-shouldered
Shit-cleaner - a shit caster!
Needed by people at all times.

Tourists come to us
I would say stupid people
Oh oh oh...
Walk along the street
And eat bananas
Oh oh oh...
And such an infection
Sitting past the toilet
Oh oh oh...
Wiping ass with finger
Does not wash away
Oh oh oh...
Shit truck, shit truck, shit truck
Bring the pump closer
Give me your scoop
And turn on the jet harder ...
Shit-cleaner, shit-cleaner, shit-cleaner
Must be hardened and broad-shouldered
Shit-cleaner - a shit caster!
Needed by people at all times.
